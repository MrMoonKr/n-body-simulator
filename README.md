three.js supports most modern browsers, including Internet Explorer 9 and above.

three.js provides WebGL, Canvas, SVG and CSS renderers. Different renderers may have different requirements of compatibility.
In theory, three.js works on all browsers that support WebGL: Google Chrome 9+, Firefox 4+, Opera 15+, Safari 5.1+, Internet Explorer 11 and Microsoft Edge. More infomation can be found at Can I use WebGL?.


If you still need to support IE9, it's a good choice to use CanvasRenderer.
