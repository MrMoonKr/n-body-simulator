## Project Description

N-Body Simulator is simple web page that uses JavaScript and Three.js to render a 3D simulation of the motion of pointlike bodies taking into account the gravitational interaction between them. 

There are several ways to initialize a simulation:

- Select a simulation scenario among 2-Body, 3-Body and N-Body scenarios
- Generate a single body selecting its mass, radius as well as its initial position and velocity
- Generate a random body

Through the "Settings" panel it is possible to change the timestep used for numerical integration and the gravitational constant.
